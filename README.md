# Rubyhave examples

Some examples to show how to use Rubyhave (https://github.com/bytebin/rubyhave)

## Installation

- Install ruby (try rvm, rbenv, ruby-install, asdf, etc...)
- `bundle install`

## Running

There is only one little goofy level (gap) in the levels folder. Go ahead and create your own if you'd like to try others.

```sh
$ bin/run gap
```
